Personal notes =

1. Further developed/consolidated my skills in react in this project and felt more comfortable compared to previous projects.
2. Learnt about the use of the useParams() hook and made use of it to deconstruct each coins id and dynamically fetch data.
3. Improved ability to use API to retrieve and manipulate fetched data to display data in the way in which I intended.
